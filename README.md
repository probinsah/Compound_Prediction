# Compound_Prediction
Predicting the presence of Chemical Compound using different Machine Learning Algorithms. 
I have calculated presence of different chemical compound in different atmosphere using four **VOC** sensors. 
* The VOC sensor directly measures ambient concentrations of a broad range of “reducing gases” associated with bad air quality. 
* Examples are: alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, organic acids, amines, organic chloramines, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. These gases all burn and cause the VOC sensor ppm output to increase.  

Our Data Contain six columns ('ID', 'Sensor1', 'Sensor2', 'Sensor3', 'Sensor4', 'Compound'). Our goal is to build a machine learning model which can predict the chemical compund present base of four different Sensors value. 

## Python Libraries that we need. 
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. sklearn
4. matplotlib

## Work Flow
1. Data Gathering.
2. Data Pre-processing. 
3. Data Visualization using matplotlib python library. 
4. Selecting the model best for our given dataset.
5. Training and Testing the data on different machine learning model. 
6. Evaluation base on the result we will get from different modes. 

##Algorithm I am using.
1. Decision Tree.
2. Logistic Regression.
3. Suppot Vector Machine.
4. K-NN (K Nearest Neighbor).

!!!!!!--------Issue--------!!!!!!
I am facing difficulty in visualization of the featured scaled data of the given dataset.
